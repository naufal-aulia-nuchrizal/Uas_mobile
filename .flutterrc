# Flutter Configuration

# This file disables Windows platform for development to avoid network issues

# Run flutter with this to skip Windows:

# flutter config --no-enable-windows

# Or run directly for specific platform:

# flutter run -d chrome (for web)

# flutter run -d android (for android emulator)
